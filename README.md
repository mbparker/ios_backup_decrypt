# iOS Backup Decrypt
Decrypt and extract files from a local ios backup. Works with ios 13 and up, including iOS 16.4.1. Heavily inspired by this repository: https://github.com/jsharkey13/iphone_backup_decrypt which is based on this stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13793043.

I've updated it to be cross platform, working on Windows, macOS, and possibly Linux via libimobiledevice (untested as of yet).
